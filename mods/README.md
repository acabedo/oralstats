As scientific interests can differ substantially from one researcher to another, there are different projects where Oralstats is directly involved. The ones below are just some of them, but the point is that they can be incremented as well as Oralstats is also being improved. All these projects, with the exception of the Discourse genre and idiolectal analysis from politicians and the analysis of the youtuber Pico de Oro/Padre Zorro*,* are still being developed.

- Sahelanthropus. This modification was developed to help researchers to characterize the speech of specific individuals. More specifically, the main idea is to compare the speech features of one person with other individuals to see in what sense this features are really shared with a speaker community or if they are idiosyncratic of this individual. So, basically, it compares the speech of one individual with the average speech coming from a global corpus.

- Ozymandias. A modification developed to deal with linked linguistic data. The aim is to analyze different discourse units (words, intonational phrases, subacts, speech acts) defined at the Val.Es.Co. speech units framework (Pons [ed.] 2014 and http://www.valesco.es).

- Discourse genre and idiolectal analysis from politicians. This is a small sample of 4 different Spanish politicians speaking along multiple oral discourse genres. You can see a demo here: https://adrin-cabedo.shinyapps.io/oralstatsgenres

- Padre zorro among genres. This version includes intonational phrases, words and phonemes recorded from an Spanish youtuber called Padre Zorro/Pico de oro. Data proceed from three different online formats: Twitch monologue, Youtube edited monologue and a Youtube polemic interview. You can check the demo here: https://adrin-cabedo.shinyapps.io/padrezorro/

- Fonocortesía. This was a funded project ended in 2013 and supervised by full professor Antonio Hidalgo Navarro. You can access this data dynamically at <http://fonocortesia.es> and also https://adrin-cabedo.shinyapps.io/fonocortesia/

- Aroca (in collaboration with Andrea Carcelén Guerrero). This is a special version and simplification from Oralstats core package: https://adrin-cabedo.shinyapps.io/oralstats-aroca It includes 105 Spanish conversations from Ameresco corpus <www.corpusameresco.com>.
